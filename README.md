# JavaScriptCourse

This program was my project based learning attempt at JavaScript using SuperSimpleDev's tutorial as a starting point (You can find the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqaTKBU9TZk).
It allowed me to learn JavaScript by making a ToDo application that lets you add new items to your list, delete previous items, and saves your data for future instances.
I also got practice using the MVC architecture (Model View Controller) which lets you organize your code in a way that professionals do while reducing redundancy.

In the practice.html file, there is code that I wrote to complete the exercises in the course to reinforce the learning.
